Typed Lua
=========

Extremely WIP!

This will eventually be a statically typed superset of Lua.

Current roadmap:

1. Implement a Lua 5.3 parser that can output the same or equivalent code.
2. Add types and static type checking to the parser.
3. Add interfaces and classes.
4. Add imported type checking.
